## 🚀 Startup Advisor As A Service (SAaaS)

**SAaaS** is designed to provide hands-on advisory for startup founders at any stage of their journey. From strategic advice to technical leadership, I offer actionable insights and practical solutions to help you navigate the startup world.

### What is SAaaS?

Think of it like Netflix for startup advice:  
Activate, pause, or cancel anytime, getting the expertise you need, when you need it.

- **No equity cost:** Keep your startup ownership intact.
- **On-demand expertise:** Access CTO-level support tailored to your needs.
- **Deliverables first:** Get results before committing long-term.

Helping founders focus on what they do best without losing sight of their goals.

- **Flexible Subscription:** Start, pause, or cancel anytime.
- **Expert Guidance:** Get strategic and technical advice without hiring full-time staff.
- **Scalable Solutions:** Designed to grow with your startup's evolving needs.
